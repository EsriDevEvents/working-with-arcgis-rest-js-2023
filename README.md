# Working with ArcGIS REST JS

ArcGIS REST JS is an open-source, compact, and easy-to-use wrapper around the ArcGIS REST APIs that simplifies working with these services in any TypeScript or JavaScript application. Learn how to integrate ArcGIS services such as routing, geocoding, demographic and feature layers into your Node.js and browser applications. We’ll also show how to use ArcGIS REST JS to manage your organization’s content, users, and groups.
